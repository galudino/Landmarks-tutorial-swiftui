SwiftUI Essentials
Creating and Combining Views

This tutorial guides you through building Landmarks — an app for discovering and sharing the places you love. 
You’ll start by building the view that shows a landmark’s details.

To lay out the views, Landmarks uses stacks to combine and layer the image and text view components. 
To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. As you refine the view’s design, 
Xcode provides real-time feedback so you can see how those changes translate into code.
```

This application consists of a single page describing an Irvine, Calfornia landmark - Turtle Rock.<br>
The description text was taken from a Wikipedia page describing Turtle Rock.
